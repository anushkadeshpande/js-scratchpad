# Generators

The purpose of a generator function is to run some code and return some value, then run some more code and return some value, and keep doing this over and over again.
In these functions, `yield` keyword is used to return the values.

In order to use the generator, we need to run the genrator function which will return a generator object which will allow us to manipulate and use the generator.
